# COSMOS PKN expert-curation blacklist
#
# Each entry is a dict of column → value pairs.  An interaction is removed
# if ALL fields in an entry match (AND logic across fields within an entry;
# OR logic across entries).
#
# Matching is exact string equality on the translated DataFrame columns:
#   source, target          — IDs after translation (ChEBI, ENSG, reaction_id)
#   resource                — e.g. 'STITCH', 'GEM:Human-GEM', 'Recon3D'
#   interaction_type        — e.g. 'transport', 'catalysis', 'receptor'
#   source_type / target_type — 'small_molecule' or 'protein'
#
# Example entries (commented out):
#
#   # Remove one specific STITCH edge known to be a false positive:
#   - source: CHEBI:15422
#     target: ENSG00000001234
#     resource: STITCH
#
#   # Remove all edges for a specific orphan reaction:
#   - target: MAR00001
#
#   # Remove all Recon3D transport edges for a known promiscuous metabolite:
#   - source: CHEBI:57618
#     resource: Recon3D
